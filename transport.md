# Coaches
We want you to enjoy your night, so we are arranging a private coach from the [hotels](hotels.html) to the [ceremony](location.html), from the ceremony to the [reception](location.html), and finally back to the hotels at the end of the night. You **must** let us know when you [RSVP](rsvp.html) which, if any, of these coaches you would like to use. 

The coach will pick up from and drop off at the Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena), the Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel, and Parr Hall Farm. The wedding ceremony will be at 12:30 so we expect hotel pickups around 11:15am; departure after the reception will be shortly after midnight. Please check back here closer to the day to confirm detailed times.

# Driving
If you are driving, we have provided [directions to the ceremony and reception venues](location.html). Please note that you *cannot* park overnight at the cermony venue but can do so at the reception; the parking lot is locked overnight and you can collect your vehicle after 9am the following morning.
