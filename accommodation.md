## Recommended Hotels

**We will be arranging coaches to and from the wedding from the Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena) and the Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel.**

####**The Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel**

We have reserved a fixed number of double rooms at [The Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel](http://www.mercurebolton.co.uk/) on the 2nd and 3rd October. The rate for double occupancy is £75 per night, and £65 per night for sole occupancy, including breakfast. 

You can make a reservation by contacting the hotel using either of the following contact methods, and quoting the reference number **FITZ02102015**:

* Telephone: +44 (0)844 815 9029 *(From Canada, replace the +44 with 01144)*
* Email: 029rs@jupiterhotels.co.uk




####**The Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena)**

We have not reserved any rooms at The Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena) (because the rate is cheaper online) but it is a large hotel near the wedding reception venue, so this is another option if you would like transport to and from the wedding.
