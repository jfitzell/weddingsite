# Recommended Hotels

**We will be arranging coaches to and from the wedding from the Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena) and the Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel.**


##The Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel

We have reserved a fixed number of double rooms at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mercurebolton.co.uk/">The Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel</a> on the 2nd and 3rd October. The rate for double occupancy is £75 per night, and £65 per night for sole occupancy, including breakfast. 

You can make a reservation by contacting the hotel using either of the following contact methods, and quoting the reference number **FITZ02102015**:

* Telephone: +44 (0)844 815 9029 *(From Canada, dial 011 44 844 815 0929)*
* Email: 029rs@jupiterhotels.co.uk

If travelling by car, the hotel is 1.5 miles along the A6 off juntion 6 on the M61. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mercurebolton.co.uk/contact.html">here</a> for more details.

If travelling by train, it's a 1.5 mile taxi journey from Horwich Parkway train station.


##The Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena)

We have not reserved any rooms at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/BOLBAR/">The Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena)</a> (because the rate is cheaper online) but it is a large hotel near the wedding reception venue, so this is another option if you would like coach transport to and from the wedding.

If travelling by car, the Premier Inn is just off junction 6 on the M61. See <a target="_blank" href="http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/BOLBAR/bolton-stadium/arena">here</a> for more details.

If travelling by train, this hotel is probably your best option! It's next to Horwich Parkway train station, which is a 20-30 minute journey from Preston or Manchester Piccadilly train station.
