**We will be arranging coaches to and from the wedding from the Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena) and the Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel.**


##The Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel

We have reserved a fixed number of double rooms at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mercurebolton.co.uk/">The Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel</a> on the 2nd and 3rd October. The rate for double occupancy is £75 per night, and £65 per night for sole occupancy, including breakfast. 

You can make a reservation by contacting the hotel using either of the following contact methods, and quoting the reference number **FITZ02102015**:

* Telephone: +44 (0)844 815 9029 *(From Canada, dial 011 44 844 815 0929)*
* Email: 029rs@jupiterhotels.co.uk




##The Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena)

We have not reserved any rooms at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/BOLBAR/">The Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena)</a> (because the rate is cheaper online) but it is a large hotel near the wedding reception venue, so this is another option if you would like coach transport to and from the wedding.
