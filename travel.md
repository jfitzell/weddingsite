The closest airports are Liverpool John Lennon airport and Manchester International airport. Manchester airport is well-connected by train but from Liverpool you'd probably want to hire a car. Alternatively, you can fly into any convenient London airport and catch a train or drive (see below for details).

# By Train

Bolton, Chorley, and Horwich Parkway are the nearest stations to the reception venue and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/accommodation.html">suggested hotels</a>. All three can be reached by frequent local trains from Manchester Piccadilly or Preston.

Fast trains run every hour or so from London Euston station to Manchester Piccadilly and Preston, taking between 2 to 2.5 hours. From Manchester and Preston, you'll be able to take a local train, hire a car, or take a taxi. 

Tickets from London go on sale 12 weeks in advance and are cheaper if bought early, but note the cheaper tickets are **only valid on a specific train**. Full price tickets can be bought at any time for about Â£80 return (as long as you travel outside rush hour) and allow travel on any train along the route.
