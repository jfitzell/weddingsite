    <p>We will be arranging coaches to and from the wedding from the Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena) and the Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel.</p>
    <p>Both hotels are close to the <a href="location.html">reception at Rivington</a>, but if travelling by train, we'd recommend staying at The Premier Inn, which is next to Horwich Parkway train station. It's a 20-30 minute journey from Preston or Manchester Piccadilly train station.</p>

##The Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel

We have reserved a fixed number of double rooms at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.mercurebolton.co.uk/">The Mercure Bolton Georgian House Hotel</a> on the 2nd and 3rd October. The rate for double occupancy is £75 per night, and £65 per night for sole occupancy, including breakfast. 

You can make a reservation by contacting the hotel using either of the following contact methods, and quoting the reference number **FITZ02102015**:

* Telephone: +44 (0)844 815 9029 *(From Canada, dial 011 44 844 815 0929)*
* Email: [029rs@jupiterhotels.co.uk](mailto:029rs@jupiterhotels.co.uk)


##The Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena)

We have not reserved any rooms at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.premierinn.com/en/hotel/BOLBAR/">The Premier Inn Bolton (Stadium/Arena)</a> (because the rate is cheaper online) but it is a large hotel near the wedding reception venue, so this is another option if you would like coach transport to and from the wedding.
